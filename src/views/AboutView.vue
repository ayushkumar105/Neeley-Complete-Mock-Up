        Neeley Complete is a program designed to encourage and guide students to a well-rounded and experiential Neeley education. Neeley Complete includes six areas of potential engagement: Research, Intercultural Education, Leadership, Service, Competitions and National Conferences, and Employer-Based Work. When students complete 4 of the 6 areas of engagement with a culminating reflection, they will have the opportunity to receive a sash or cord of recognition to wear during graduation, as well as an invitation to a graduation social and networking event with other Neeley Complete students.
